# Aging and Expansion Analyses

These scripts are separated into 3 parts: first creating the aging and expansion data, then secondly creating the matched samples and running the whole brain regression analyses, and finally running the various comparisons between aging and expansion presented in the manuscript.

All the results from these analyses for the manuscript are availble to download [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10141986).
