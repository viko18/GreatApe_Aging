# Cross-Species Registration

The modulated jacobians and used to create the cross-species expansion maps as well as the chimpanzee (Juna) to human (MNI) deformation field map for deforming OPNMF solution to MNI space can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7116203#.YzLvCfexWV4).

The ```exp_create.sh``` script uses FSL in particular ```fslmaths``` to mask and establish the expansion maps from the jacobians.
